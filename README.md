# clicky-game
This is a simple React App, that demonstrates extensive use of State and Props.

This project uses Bootstrap v4.1.3 for most of it's components, and Knuth Shuffle to shuffle the cards array, sampled from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array) with minor modifications.

To get started with this project, you can clone the repo, run an `npm install` in the "clicky-game" folder, and then `npm run start` to run the React Server.

Alternatively, you can view the app live on GitHub Pages [Here!](https://declanmorrison.github.io/clicky-game/).
